An OpenCL accelerated TDD/FDD LTE Scanner. By Jiao Xianjun (putaoshu@gmail.com).

Before explore this LTE Scanner, it's better for you to do some homeworks:

1. Original FDD only LTE Cell Scanner / Tracker: https://github.com/Evrytania/LTE-Cell-Scanner , by James Peroulas.

2. rtl-sdr ultra cheap USB TV dongle: http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr

ATTENTION!!! Only v0.5.2 librtlsdr (https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr) works with this LTE Scanner. Not v0.5.3! (at least for my computer)

ATTENTION!!! Please use release version instead of dev trunk if you want a 100% workable program.

ATTENTION!!! If you got -4(CL_MEM_OBJECT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE) or -5(CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES) error in some OpenCL platform-device, try smaller PPM value to narrow frequency offset range (only valid in original twist mode: -t).

MATLAB algorithm study and experiments are in : https://github.com/JiaoXianjun/rtl-sdr-LTE

-----------------------------------------------------------------
New features and Usages
-----------------------------------------------------------------

"CellSearch --help" to see all options.

1. ----------------------OpenCL support----------------------

"cd LTE-Cell-Scanner"

"mkdir build"

"cd build"

"cmake ../"

(Before cmake, the build directory should better be cleaned.)

In default, "cmake ../" tries to find and use OpenCL to get speedup.

"cmake .. -DUSE_OPENCL=0" forces not to use OpenCL.

So, make sure OpenCL SDK has been installed in your system correctly, if you want LTE Scanner accelerated.

Intel, AMD, Nvidia, they all have free OpenCL SDK for their CPU/GPUs. There are also some other open source OpenCLs SDK,
such as pocl - Portable Computing Language (https://github.com/pocl/pocl)

"make" to generate executable program.

Before run test, those kernel files (src/*.cl) should be put together with executable program or in $PATH.
Because they need to be compiled and executed by OpenCL runtime after program launch.

Run test:

"CellSearch --loadbin test/f1890_s1.92_g0_0.16s.bin --opencl-platform=0 --opencl-device=0 --filter-workitem=32 --xcorr-workitem=2"

OpenCL platform and device are specified by "--opencl-platform=idx1 --opencl-device=idx2" to decide which CPU/GPU is used.
When program runs, it tells you how many platforms are detected in total. Default index is 0.

Number of workitems for 6RB channel filter kernel can be specified by "--filter-workitem". Default value is 32.

Number of workitems in the 1st NDrange dimension for PSS frequency-time correlation kernel can be specified by "--xcorr-workitem".
(ATTENTION!!! Now it is omitted because #define FILTER_MCHN_SIMPLE_KERNEL in searcher.h)
Default value is 2. PSS correlation always has the 2nd NDrange dimension with 72 workitems (non-twist mode) or 273 workitems (twist mode).

Optimal number of workitems is platform-device dependent. Optimal values should be found according to your computer configuration.

2. -----TDD, ext-LNB/mixer, pre-search algorithm improvement-----

"CellSearch --freq-start 1860e6 -t"

"-t" forces program into original carrier-sampling-clock twisted mode. Without "-t" leads to non-twisted mode (default mode).

Default mode supports external LNB and fast pre-search.
See detailed explanation in https://github.com/JiaoXianjun/rtl-sdr-LTE , and videos: (inside China): http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNjc1MjIzMDEy.html ,
 (outside China): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zRLgxzn4Pc )

"CellSearch --loadbin test/f1890_s1.92_g0_0.16s.bin --num-reserve=4"

"--num-reserve" specifies how many frequency-PPM pairs are reserved in search process. Default value is 1.

3. --------Capture and reload rtl-sdr raw uint8 bin file--------

"CellSearch --freq-start 1860e6 --recbin a.bin" saves signal in file a.bin while doing cell search at frequency 1.86GHz

"CellSearch --loadbin test/f1890_s1.92_g0_0.16s.bin" searches LTE cell in captured bin file test/f1890_s1.92_g0_0.16s.bin

4. ------------Multiple tries at one frequency point------------

"CellSearch test/noise.bin --num-try 10" performs 10 tries of searching at frequency 1.86GHz (When signal is weak, only one try may not have you good luck)


Original Readme of James Peroulas's LTE Cell Scanner / Tracker
========================================================================

--------------------------
LTE Cell Scanner / Tracker
--------------------------

This is a collection of tools to locate and track LTE basestation cells using
very low performance RF front ends. For example, these tools work with RTL2832
based dongles (E4000, R820T, etc.) which have a noise figure of 20dB, only 8
bits in the A/D, and a crystal with a frequency error of about 100 ppm.

The 'CellSearch' program can be used to search for LTE carriers within a range
of frequencies.  Once an LTE frequency has been located, 'LTE-Tracker' can be
used to monitor and track, in realtime, any LTE cells on that frequency.

The main documentation in html format can be found on the web at:
  http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools
And in the doc/index.html subdirectory of this distribution.
